# cig_wrapper
This is a database wrapper built in PHP. This is something I worked on while I was still learning PHP, so I don't advise using it for your projects, or if you do, you gotta take a good look at it first. I am still learning about OOP concepts and principles like SOLID, DI, etc. so please don't be too hard on me :). All your advices are welcomed.
